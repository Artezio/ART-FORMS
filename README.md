# **ART-FORMS**
FHIR compatibly questionnaire designer/player. If you are not familiar with medical standard FHIR check out the [following refs](#interesting-references).

Art-forms is a set of typescript packages. It presents two react components: "Questionnaire Designer" and "Questionnaire Player". Questionnaire designer is designed to create/update questionnaires. Questionnaire player is designed to answer questionnaires. Components are designed in bootstrap style, so you can easily add bootstrap themes to change there appearance. This components work with our observable models from models package, but this models are fully compatible with fhir standard. All models can be converted to fhir standard and back via fhir-converter package.
