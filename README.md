# **ART-FORMS**

Art-forms is a set of typescript packages designed for creating and completing  questionnaires which are fully compatible with [FHIR standard](http://hl7.org/fhir/). It presents two react components: "Questionnaire Designer" and "Questionnaire Player". Questionnaire designer can create or update questionnaire. Questionnaire player is designed to pass the questionnaire. Components were designed in bootstrap style, so you can easily add bootstrap themes to change there appearance. This components work with our observable models from models package, but this models are fully compatible with fhir standard. All models can be converted to fhir standard and back via fhir-converter package.
